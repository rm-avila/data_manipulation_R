fill(data, ..., .direction = c("down", "up"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{...}{A selection of columns. If empty, nothing happens. You can
supply bare variable names, select all variables between \code{x} and \code{z}
with \code{x:z}, exclude \code{y} with \code{-y}. For more selection options, see the

\description{
Fills missing values in selected columns using the previous entry. This is useful in the
common output format where values are not repeated, they're recorded
each time they change.
}
\details{
Missing values are replaced in atomic vectors; \code{NULL}s are replaced
in list.

\examples{
df <- data.frame(Month = 1:12, Year = c(2000, rep(NA, 11)))
