# could not find function "n"

This is the main problem. Previous versions of `dplyr` gave `n()`
a special magic treatment. This however was a source of 
[subtle bugs](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/3861). 

Fixing the behaviour was part of the hybrid evaluation re implementation, 
now `n()` is just like any other function, when using it in packages and
scripts. 

If you get the error `could not find function "n"` from a function in your 
package, it means that you need to import the `n` function, there are 
several ways to do that: 
 
 - selectively import it, using an `importFrom` directive in your
   namespace, or if you use `roxygen2` a `#' @importFrom dplyr n`. 
   
 - import `dplyr` as a whole, with the namespace directive `import(dplyr)`
   or with the roxygen2 comment `#' @import dplyr`
   
 - prefix the function, i.e. call it `dplyr::n()`
 
If you get the error in scripts, the easiest way to fix it is to load
dplyr with `library(dplyr)`, otherwise you can prefix the function 
with `dplyr::n()`

# Empty groups

As describe in the [pre release article](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/12/dplyr-0-8-0-release-candidate/), 
dplyr 0.8.0 is more respectful of factor levels and therefore may create empty groups. 

This might be causing problems for packages:

# Corrupt data frames

dplyr 0.8.0 is stricter about what is a grouped data frame

```

psychmeta

radiant.model     seems to be making old structure for grouped data frames
rPref             seems to asume old strcuture
```

# sample_n

The `sample_n()` generic gained a `...` argument. This gives a warning for packages: 

```
bupaR
dplyr.teradata
dtplyr            (not reallt a ... problem, but related to sample_n)
tidygraph
